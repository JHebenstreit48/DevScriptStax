  <h1>About DevScriptStax</h1>

  DevScriptStax is a personal, continually-evolving reference for
  <span class="emphasis">full stack web development</span>. It began as a React refresh
  of a small HTML project and has grown into structured notes across frontend, backend,
  testing & tooling, GraphQL & Apollo, styling strategies, databases, and cloud & deployment.

  <strong>Current focus:</strong> information architecture and runtime performance.
  The sites are moving toward deeper category granularity, consistent subpage structure, and
  lazy-loaded routing for faster, more predictable navigation.
