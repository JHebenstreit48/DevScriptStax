<div class="siteInfoContent">
  DevScriptStax is a personal knowledge base for full stack web development. It began as a React
  remake of a simple HTML project from a bootcamp and has grown into a structured, evolving space
  for long-term learning across the entire stack. Notes span frontend and backend concepts,
  development tools, testing, GraphQL and Apollo, styling strategies, and much more.

  This site also tracks my exploration of frameworks, libraries, databases, and cloud services—all
  organized to grow alongside my skills as a developer.

<div class="Note">
  NOTE: Each project is focused on organizing technical knowledge across different domains. All of
  them are being actively maintained, but current efforts are focused on refactoring routing,
  navigation, and lazy-loaded pages for NetNotes and DevScriptStax.

  Also, many pages and features may still be in progress as this site is continually refined. Use
  the navigation above to explore notes on React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, GraphQL,
  Apollo, testing libraries, design patterns, cloud deployment tools, and more.
