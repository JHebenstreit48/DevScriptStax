<div class="siteInfoContent">
  DevScriptStax is a personal knowledge base for <span class="emphasis">full stack web development</span>.
  It began as a React remake of a simple HTML project from a bootcamp and has grown into a structured,
  evolving space for long-term learning across the entire stack. Notes span frontend and backend concepts,
  development tools, testing, GraphQL and Apollo, styling strategies, and much more.  

  This site also tracks my exploration of frameworks, libraries, databases, and cloud services—all
  organized to grow alongside my skills as a developer.

  This project shares a common structure with several others:

- <span class="projectName">NetNotes:</span> <span class="projectDescrip">(networking and Cisco technologies)</span>  
- <span class="projectName">AppFoundry:</span> <span class="projectDescrip">(mobile app and game development)</span>  
- <span class="projectName">PixelProse:</span> <span class="projectDescrip">(non-mobile game development)</span>

<div class="Note">
  NOTE: All four projects—DevScriptStax, NetNotes, AppFoundry, and PixelProse—are currently undergoing
  a major refactor of navigation and routes. The primary focus is on granularizing categories and
  subpages, restructuring content for consistency, and implementing lazy-loaded routing across the
  sites.  

  While this structural work is the main priority, new notes and topic pages are also being added in
  parallel, though content expansion is not the central focus at this stage. Use the navigation above
  to explore notes on React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, GraphQL, Apollo, testing libraries,
  design patterns, cloud deployment tools, and more.
